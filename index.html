		<h1>✨Hi! I'm Mafer✨</h1>
		<img src="images/picture.png">
		<p class="cards-shape">I'm a 20-year-old currently studying Economics in King's College London🇬🇧. I'm both Peruvian🇵🇪 and Swiss🇨🇭, and one of my all-time favourite things to do is <strong>to travel</strong> and explore new places💫. I'm very passionate about <strong>maths</strong>, love practicing <strong>yoga</strong>, and have been spending a lot of time lately learning how to code. I've always enjoyed <strong>tutoring</strong>, which is why I'm now working on a new project focused on improving education for underprivileged children in Peru during the ongoing pandemic. During quarantine I've also been learning new <strong>marketing skills</strong> and created an instagram page for my dad who's a surgeon, check it out on the link below!👇🏼</p>

			<h2>Yoga</h2>
			<p>I started practicing yoga in January 2019 with my godmother, and I've spent time on my mat almost every day since. What I enjoy practicing the most are inversions and backbends; seeing the world from different angles✨</p>

			<h2>Tutoring</h2>
			<p>I've always loved teaching and, apart from working as a tutor, I've been involved in different projects regarding public education in my country. In 2017 I volunteered for a couple of hours a week and taught second graders in a public school near mine. The problem with public education in developing countries is that the quality isn't good, and so a group of friends and I committed to helping these students pass their Ministry’s Mandatory 2nd Grade Examination.<br> A more recent problem regarding education which arised from the lockdown is that most of schools in Peru don't have access to internet and institutions don't provide online classes. I entered a program called "Enséñame" to teach children in the meanwhile so they don't fall behind and lose the year.</p>

			<h2>Travelling</h2>
			<p>Having been raised in Peru, a multicultural country with a fascinating historical background, I've always been interested in discovering new cultures. What I enjoy most about visiting new places is speaking to local people and visiting history museums. Plus, I love taking pictures of the landscapes and skylines.</p>
